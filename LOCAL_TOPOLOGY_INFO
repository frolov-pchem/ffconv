DESCRIPTTION

Here we describe the local topology database (DB). It is aimed to store single molecule Force Field (FF) files 
for different MD codes. An entry into DB can be put by hand or by the script "ffconv.py" (frolov-pchem.wikispaces.com).
The DB is organized in the following way:
 - First-level subdirectories - names of the MD codes (e.g. GROMACS, AMBER, CHARMM).
 -- Second-level subdirectories - names of the FFs (e.g. cgenff2b7, oplsaa, gaff)
 --- Third-level subdirectories - names of molecules (e.g. paracetamol, tip3p)

 GROMACS/oplsaa folder description:
        - file "defaults.itp" - contains the defaults section of the Gromacs topology file for OPLSAA force field
        - "molecule" subfolder (e.g. molecule = paracetamol) - contains sinngle molecle include topology files (itp):
            = molecule.itp - description of the molecule atoms, bonds, angles, etc
            = molecule_AT.itp - description of the atomtypes used in the molecule.itp. Here one must say that we stick to 
                              the output of the "ffld_server" program, which outputs only atoms for given molecules, but 
                              not the entire opls ff description. However, in gromacs you may not give nonbonded potential
                              parameters inside the atoms descriptions in molecule.itp, the should be give in [ atomtypes ]
                              section of Gromacs topology file. Moreover, one may not add [ atomtypes ] section after a 
                              molecule is given ([ molecule ]). Therefore, we need to split the full description of the 
                              molecule ITP to two files, and firstly in topology file we include all molecule_AT.itp files
                              and after that all molecule.itp files.
            = posre.itp - position restraines for given molecule
            = molecule.pdb - PDB coordinates for given molecule

  GROMACS/cgenff2b7 folder description:
        - file "cgenff2b7.itp" - Charmm General FF Version 2b7 as given by https://paramchem.org/ (par_all36_cgenff.prm) and 
                                 converted to Gromacs format by "ffconv.py". For given molecular PDB file the paramchem.org 
                                 generates only topology of the molecule (charmm topology stream file, str) which uses 
                                 atomtypes, atombonds, etc. from the par_all36_cgenff.prm file. Here we keep this way of
                                 organization. This file contains full descritption of the CGenFF2b7 force field.
        - "molecule" subfolder (e.g. molecule = paracetamol) - contains sinngle molecle include topology files (itp):
            = molecule.itp - description of the molecule atoms, bonds, angles, etc. as converted from charmm topology stream 
                             file generated by paramchem.org server. 
            = posre.itp - position restraines for given molecule
            = molecule.pdb - PDB coordinates for given molecule
